# Skyrim Terrain Slot Unlocker

SKSE plugin which allows Skyrim to read more than just diffuse and normal slots for terrain

This plugin is derived from the work of the Community Shaders TruePBR feature, which allows for terrain with PBR-relevant slots. This plugin expands that to all available slots and removes the dependency on Community Shaders. The Community Shaders repository can be found [here](https://github.com/doodlum/skyrim-community-shaders). Give them a star!

**WIP DOES NOT WORK YET**
